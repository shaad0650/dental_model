🦷 Dental Gingivitis Prediction Model

A machine learning–based system for predicting gingivitis risk using dental health indicators. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how data-driven models can assist in early identification of gingivitis for educational and research purposes.

Problem Statement

Gingivitis is a common and preventable gum disease, but early symptoms are often ignored or misidentified. This project explores whether machine learning models can predict gingivitis risk based on observable dental and oral health features.

Approach:

Collected and preprocessed dental health data

Performed feature analysis and cleaning

Trained supervised ML models for classification

Evaluated model performance using standard metrics

Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn
